First assignment of the JS Fullstack Path, The Odin Project. OOP


After completion of 1.0. I faced a lot of challenges making this page. From the very beginning. Learning constructos and how to use that to add to an array. This retrieve this array infomation to make a card. Alongside making it responsive and have a nice color scheme. Then after I completed the basic function, having to REWRITE my code to incorporate local storage. Using local storage to save and then call from that storage to create the data on the page. I learned a lot. As a goal for version 2.0, I would like to create a waiting list, or another page for books I want to read in the future. I will, however, revist that idea after I have practiced with Express/Node.js or another database.
